Danner Tassone is the Founder and CEO of The Haze Agency (THA), partnerships agency connecting luxury brands and celebrity talent. A dual citizen to America and Australia, Danner has spent the last decade working in print and specialist entertainment in London.

Sitting previously as Associate Publisher of luxury fashion and lifestyle publications (Wonderland, Man About Town, Rollacoaster and AMAZING), she has worked with clients like LVMH, Nike, COTY, Sony Music, UMG, Netflix, Amazon, MTV, Diageo and many more.

During this time, she developed print, digital and social commercial partnership strategies for brands, celebrity and emerging talents across multiple platforms and markets. Her motto: connecting the right talent with the right brands, to create outstanding content. When sheâ€™s not working on partnerships and collaborations, Danner spends her time connecting with inspiring minds and fellow creatives in order to keep evolving and to motivate others. She also sits as a commercial agent for a roster of global publications and brands - constantly on the lookout for unique brand and talent collaborations for her clients. Furthermore, Danner specialises in brand and talent product collaboration, overseeing the process from ideation to commercialisation. Inspired to start THA as a refreshing deviation from an industry saturated with doing too much, too quickly, Danner focuses on creating meaningful work and having fun at the same time.
