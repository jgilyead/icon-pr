No matter where she is or who she’s with, Gayle Davidson has a connection. From a tiny fishing village in Indonesia, to a majestic homestead in Australia, to the suburbs of London, to the hipster corners of Brooklyn, to the veneers of Hollywood… Gayle knows-a-guy.

Having lived and worked in every major media hub of the world, Gayle cut her teeth with actors and playwrights and then graduated to songwriters, producers and music supervisors. Later, she established herself in the intermingled worlds of songwriting, production, management, marketing, booking, and PR. She has worked with artists in every relevant genre, through release campaigns, licensing deals, break-ups, make-ups, tours, and videos. A 6’2 powerhouse, Gayle balances lovable aggression with a Mary Poppins bedside manner. Now, shifting out of development and into the mainstream, Gayle is a perfect fit for the Icon PR team and is excited to bring her expertise to their Nashville office.
