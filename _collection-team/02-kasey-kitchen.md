Kasey Kitchen is a senior publicist specializing in entertainment public relations.  Born in Miami, FL, and raised in Atlanta, GA Kitchen got her first taste of entertainment as a dancer and actress which she pursued professionally.  Her love of performing carried her to such cities as New York and London before settling in Los Angeles in 2009.  Before taking the leap into public relations, Kitchen came very close to a career with the FBI as a communications liaison for the Behavior Analysis Unit.  Needless to say, her calling to the world of entertainment couldn’t be ignored making her once again return to where it all began for her.

Prior to her joining ICON PR, Kitchen served as a senior publicist at Pinnacle Public Relations and East 2 West Collective spearheading campaigns for a myriad of talent across the realms of film and television.  Through forward thinking and the utilization of creative narratives Kitchen has achieved great success for her clients in the acquisition of press spanning print and digital publications, radio, and broadcast interviews.  Kitchen possesses an ability to go beyond traditional PR by implementing an artistic strategy that is uniquely catered to each individual client, with the ultimate goal of furthering their craft as artists while also maintaining longevity and relevancy in their careers—traits that are most vital in today’s vastly changing industry.
