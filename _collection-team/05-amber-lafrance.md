Amber LaFrance, President and Executive Publicist of CultureHype, has spent the last 10 years pushing the envelope of public relations. Her rule-breaking approach bucks tradition every step of the way, ensuring her clients stand out from the crowd.

Amber is a longtime advocate of Texas game-changers who began her career by shining an international spotlight on the state’s vibrant arts and culture scene. With her industry knowledge and unstoppable work ethic, she’s landed clients in top media like Forbes, Women's Wear Daily, Wall Street Journal, Wired, The New York Times, Refinery29, Texas Monthly, Jimmy Kimmel Live, and BuzzFeed.

In addition to her work with local creatives, Amber now partners with national brands, using her killer connections to create widespread buzz. She is the recipient of numerous industry awards.

Amber also heads two additional full-time businesses–we told you she’s a hustler–including DFW Style Daily and the historic Longhorn Ballroom live music venue.

Amber believes good PR is about more than selling a story. It’s about building one from the ground-up, and she’s just getting started.
